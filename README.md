# Breeze Wallet with Breeze Privacy Protocol

__Warning: This is an experimental build. At the moment, only bitcoin on testnet is supported but more is coming soon. Use at your own risk.__
This is the repository of the Breeze Wallet, the first full-block SPV bitcoin wallet using Angular and Electron at the front-end and C# with .NET Core in the back-end.

This version includes a feature where the Wallet automatically connects to a live Masternode running the Breeze Privacy Protocol.  This is achieved by using the blockchain enabled Masternode Advertisement and Client Discovery Protocol. 

## Daemon Build

Breeze daemon is the backend REST service, hosting a Bitcoin node upon which Breeze UI depends:

```
# Clone and go in the directory
git clone https://github.com/breezehub/BreezeProject
cd Breeze

# Initialize dependencies
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Go in the Breeze deamon folder
cd Breeze/src/Breeze.Daemon
dotnet build

# Run the Bitcoin and Stratis light daemons on testnet in separate terminals
dotnet run -- light registration -testnet -tumblebit -storedir=C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\StratisNode\stratis\StratisTest\registrationHistory.json
dotnet run -- light stratis registration -testnet -addnode=13.64.76.48 -addnode=51.141.51.129 -addnode=98.229.142.125
```

## CI Build
-----------

We use [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) for Windows CI builds and [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) (coming soon) for our Linux and MacOS ones.
Every time someone pushes to the master branch or create a pull request on it, a build is triggered and a new unstable app release is created.

To skip a build, for example if you've made very minor changes, include the text **[skip ci]** or **[ci skip]** in your commits' comment (with the squared brackets).

If you want the :sparkles: latest :sparkles: (unstable :bomb:) version of the Breeze app, you can get it here:
